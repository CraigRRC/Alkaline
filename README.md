## Workflow

1) Pull from develop often
2) Use prefabs almost all the time
3) If you need to change a scene, make sure nobody else has changed that scene.
4) Create a branch with the name of the feature you are working on. Ex: CharacterMovement
5) Work with team on merge conflicts.
6) Merge branch into develop when the feature is complete
7) Pull from develop often

## Workflow Update:
You can now merge your own changes.
Feel free to merge small changes that you make into develop.
In terms of scene changes, should wait for someone else to review changes instead of pushing that change individually as 99% of the time people will be working on prefabs. 
Changes made to scenes will typically be significant and any testing done with prefabs should be removed afterwards or at least put in a separate testing scene.
