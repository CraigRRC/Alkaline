## Workflow

1) Pull from develop often
2) Use prefabs almost all the time
3) If you need to change a scene, make sure nobody else has changed that scene.
4) Create a branch with the name of the feature you are working on. Ex: CharacterMovement
5) Work with team on merge conflicts.
6) Merge branch into develop when the feature is complete
7) Pull from develop often
