## Workflow

1) Pull from develop often
2) Use prefabs almost all the time
3) If you need to change a scene, make sure nobody else has changed that scene.
4) Create a branch with the name of the feature you are working on. Ex: CharacterMovement
5) Work with team on merge conflicts.
6) Merge branch into develop when the feature is complete
7) Pull from develop often

## Workflow Update:
You can now merge your own changes.
Feel free to merge small changes that you make into develop.
For larger pieces of code, you can request to have someone review your pull request.
